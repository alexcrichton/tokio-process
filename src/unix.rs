/// Right now the only "fancy" thing about this is how we implement the
/// `Future` implementation on `Child` to get the exit status. Unix offers
/// no way to register a child with epoll, and the only real way to get a
/// notification when a process exits is the SIGCHLD signal.
///
/// Signal handling in general is *super* hairy and complicated, and it's even
/// more complicated here with the fact that signals are coalesced, so we may
/// not get a SIGCHLD-per-child.
///
/// Our best approximation here is to check *all spawned processes* for all
/// SIGCHLD signals received. To do that we create a `Signal`, implemented in
/// the `tokio-signal` crate, which is a stream over signals being received.
///
/// Later when we poll the process's exit status we simply check to see if a
/// SIGCHLD has happened since we last checked, and while that returns "yes" we
/// keep trying.
///
/// Note that this means that this isn't really scalable, but then again
/// processes in general aren't scalable (e.g. millions) so it shouldn't be that
/// bad in theory...
